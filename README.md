# flatlander

Flatlander is an open-source AI agent project that aims to create a highly adaptable and intelligent system capable of navigating complex environments and making informed decisions. Named in honor of Beowulf Schaffer, Flatlander is designed to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence by exploring novel approaches to learning, reasoning, and decision-making.

The project's primary objective is to develop an AI agent that can learn from its environment, reason about its actions, and adapt to changing circumstances. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies like Langchain and Crew.ai, Flatlander aims to create a new generation of AI agents that can operate in a wide range of domains, from natural language processing to robotics and beyond.

Ultimately, Flatlander's goal is to build a flexible and scalable AI framework that can be applied to various industries and use cases, driving innovation and progress in areas such as automation, healthcare, finance, and education.
